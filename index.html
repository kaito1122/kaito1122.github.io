        Hello, my name is Kaito! I am a fifth-year Northeastern student from Tokyo, majoring in Data Science. As a Data Science student, I could say my serious interest revolves around researching the latest AI models and influence of it in the world economy. While everyone is interested in this topic to some extent, I am confident I am one of the more knowledgeable side, as I am currently serving as a TA on Neural Networks class myself and have done an internship implementing LLM system to help the company's sales representative. Very interested in where the future will take us while a little bit scared on the speed of it. <br><br>

        My casual interest revolves around my Japanese identity. Actually, this became a lot more popular in recent years globally, so I no longer represent this as my quirky cultural thing, but I love reading manga and watching anime of several kinds. The genre ranges from sci-fi to battle to comedy to even philosophical, but I believe it really deepens one's view and opens up to new perspectives. My most particularly favorite genre, however, is called Shibuya Punk or Grind Fiction, which is represented in the image below.
