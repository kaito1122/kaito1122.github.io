    <h2>More About Grind Fiction</h2>
    <p>
        According to an online forum, Grind Fiction (or Shibuya Punk or Animemo) is a conceptual sub-genre of fictional media that engages with specific concepts and interplay that promote ideas of rebellion, individuality, youthful resonance, and urban glory. It is this value of vibrant yet rebellious youth that attracts many people. And this genre is also characterized by the combination of anime-style art style with graffiti and streetwear fashion. My first encounter with Grind Fiction was a Splatoon, a video game that came out in 2015 when I was in middle school. I was captivated by its use of iconic graffiti art style, fashion, and overall aesthetic concept. Moreover, the official illustration was a manifestation of Grind Fiction aesthetic genre itself. 
        <br><br>
        In my interpretation, the preface of Grind Fiction is almost always futuristic (though not necessarily), which connects to my another interest of futuristic technologies such as AI. It is somewhat chaotic, somewhat futuristic, somewhat grungy and punk, and always vibrant. This is an amalgamation of Western culture of graffiti and Eastern culture of anime and video games, which almost reminds me of Cyberpunk aesthetic that significantly influenced medias such as Blade Runner 2049 and Matrix. They are both heavily influenced by Japanese media and depict machine-dominated future, which we are slowly heading towards to. One of the big differences between Cyberpunk and Grind Fiction, however, is their emphasis on art. In the Grind Fiction world, like Splatoon or Cyberpunk 2077 or Gachiakuta, no matter how chaotic and apocalyptic the world seems, people never forget and give up on art, which is what makes them human!
